Crypto ETF Index - Investor Relations and Inquiry

Welcome to the Investor Relations page for Crypto ETF Index, a pioneering analytics platform dedicated to transforming how investors engage with crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We appreciate your interest in our platform and are committed to fostering transparent and compliant communication with potential stakeholders.

**About Crypto ETF Index: Design and Goals**
Crypto ETF Index is a self-funded, innovative platform set to launch on July 24, 2025. Our mission is to empower investors by providing advanced visualization tools tailored for crypto ETF portfolios. We aim to bridge the gap between complex crypto market data and actionable insights through intuitive analytics, including:

- **Asset Distribution Visualization**: Interactive pie charts to display portfolio allocations.
- **Historical Performance Tracking**: Line, bar, and starburst charts to analyze asset trends over time.
- **User-Centric Features**: Support for CSV/Excel portfolio uploads and wallet connect integration, ensuring seamless data input.
- **Tiered Access Model**: From Free (basic pie charts) to Enterprise (advanced starburst charts), catering to diverse user needs.

Our goal is to democratize access to sophisticated crypto analytics while maintaining the highest standards of usability and regulatory compliance. As the crypto industry evolves, Crypto ETF Index is positioned to become a trusted tool for retail and institutional investors alike.

**Regulatory Context and Compliance**
The U.S. Government and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are actively working to regulate the cryptocurrency industry, introducing frameworks to protect investors and ensure market integrity. Crypto ETF Index is developed with full awareness of these evolving regulations, and we are committed to adhering to all applicable U.S. laws, including but not limited to:

- **SEC Compliance**: We operate as a technology provider, not a broker-dealer or investment advisor. We do not provide investment advice, manage client funds, or engage in activities requiring SEC registration under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our platform is designed to provide data visualization tools only, and users are responsible for their investment decisions.
- **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC)**: Any potential partnerships or investor engagements will require strict adherence to AML and KYC regulations, ensuring compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and related SEC guidelines.
- **Accredited Investor Standards**: Inquiries from individuals or firms must comply with SEC Rule 501 of Regulation D, verifying accredited investor status where applicable.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: We align with U.S. data protection laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and emerging federal standards, to safeguard user data and ensure transparency in data handling.

As a self-funded entity, Crypto ETF Index has been developed without external investor funding, allowing us to maintain full control over our vision and compliance strategy. We are not actively seeking investment at this time but recognize the growing interest in crypto analytics platforms as the industry matures under regulatory oversight.
