1. Introduction
The cryptocurrency market has experienced unprecedented growth, with the introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) marking a significant milestone in mainstream adoption. As of May 2025, the U.S. Government and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are actively shaping regulatory frameworks to ensure investor protection and market stability. Crypto ETF Index emerges as a self-funded, innovative analytics platform designed to empower investors with advanced visualization tools for crypto ETF portfolios. Launched independently on July 24, 2025, this whitepaper details our approach, technology, and commitment to compliance in this evolving landscape.

4. Technical Architecture
The Crypto ETF Index platform is built with a modular architecture separating frontend and backend components:

- Frontend :
  - Built with HTML5, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript.
  - Utilizes Chart.js for visualization, enhanced with plugins like chartjs-chart-sunburst and chartjs-plugin-zoom.
  - Hosted on a public GitHub repository (crypto-etf-frontend) for transparency.
  - Features particle.js for an engaging UI and axios for API requests.

- Backend :
  - Developed with Node.js and Express.js, hosted in a private GitHub repository (crypto-etf-backend).
  - Handles CSV/Excel parsing with csv-parse and xlsx libraries.
  - Manages file uploads via Multer, storing temporary files in an `uploads/` directory.
  - Provides RESTful APIs:
    - `/api/upload-file`: Processes CSV/Excel uploads.
    - `/api/wallet-connect`: Accepts JSON wallet data.
    - `/api/chart-data`: Returns pie chart data (expandable to other chart types).
  - Uses in-memory storage for portfolios (to be upgraded to SQLite in future iterations).

- Security :
  - Implements CORS for cross-origin request handling.
  - Requires `user-id` headers for authentication (to be replaced with JWT in production).
  - Deletes uploaded files post-processing to minimize data retention.

- Scalability : Designed for low initial load, with plans to integrate cloud hosting (e.g., AWS) and a database for persistent storage.
