Crypto ETF Index Risk Policy

Effective Date: July 15, 2025

1.  Introduction Crypto ETF Index (“we”, “us”, or “Company”), a Texas-based AI research company specializing in machine learning and blockchain as a network service (BaaNS), is dedicated to advancing innovative technologies. This Risk Policy outlines key risks associated with our research, websites (CryptoETFIndex.com and cetfichain.com), and any interactions or potential investments. By accessing our sites or engaging with us, you acknowledge these risks.

2.  Research and Technology Risks a. AI and Machine Learning Uncertainties: Our focus on developing and training machine learning models for blockchain applications involves experimental technologies. Models trained on billions of data points may yield unexpected results, including inaccuracies, biases, or failures in real-world applications. b. Blockchain Vulnerabilities: Research into blockchain as a network service (BaaNS) carries risks such as smart contract bugs, network congestion, scalability issues, and security breaches like 51% attacks or exploits. c. Performance Claims: References to achievements like 100,000 TPS in controlled environments are experimental and not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may vary significantly. d. Development Delays: Our pivot to AI research may lead to delays in releasing updates, white papers, or prototypes. Safety testing is prioritized, but unforeseen technical challenges could arise.

3.  Investment and Financial Risks a. No Offer of Securities: Crypto ETF Index is a research entity and does not currently offer securities, tokens, or investment products. Any discussions are informational only. b. High-Risk Nature: Investments in AI and blockchain research are speculative and may result in total loss. Factors include market volatility, regulatory changes, and technological obsolescence. c. No Financial Advice: We do not provide investment, financial, legal, or tax advice. Consult qualified professionals before making decisions. d. Economic Factors: Broader economic conditions, such as inflation, recessions, or cryptocurrency market fluctuations, could impact our research and any future opportunities.

4.  Regulatory and Compliance Risks a. Evolving Regulations: AI and blockchain technologies face uncertain and changing regulations globally, including data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) and securities regulations (e.g., SEC). Non-compliance could affect our operations. b. Intellectual Property: Our research involves novel discoveries; however, patent disputes or IP theft could occur. c. International Users: Users outside the U.S. may face additional risks due to differing laws.

5.  Operational and Security Risks a. Data Security: While we implement robust measures, cyber threats like hacking or data breaches could compromise research data or user information. b. Third-Party Dependencies: Reliance on external providers (e.g., cloud services) introduces risks of service disruptions or data loss. c. No Warranties: Our websites and research materials are provided “as is” without warranties. We disclaim liability for errors, omissions, or damages arising from use.

6.  User Responsibilities a. Due Diligence: Users must conduct their own research and risk assessment. b. No Guarantees: Past experiments or achievements do not predict future success. c. Limitation of Liability: To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.

7.  Changes to This Policy We may update this policy periodically. Changes will be posted on our websites with the updated effective date.
